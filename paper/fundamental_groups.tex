\subsection{Circle}
\label{sec:circle_fund_group}

We construct an algebra of the circle in groupoid and we prove it
equivalent to initial algebra of the circle in groupoid.

\subsection{Torus}
\label{sec:torus_fund_group}

We construct an algebra of the torus in groupoid and we prove it
equivalent to initial algebra of the torus in groupoid.

\subsection{Group Quotient}
\label{sec:group_quotient_fund_group}

Let $G$ be a group.  We construct an algebra of the group quotient of $G$ in
groupoid and we prove it equivalent to initial algebra of the group
quotient of $G$ in groupoid.
