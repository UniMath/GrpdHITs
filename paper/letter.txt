Dear Martin,

Thanks for accepting our paper. We would also like to express our
gratitude to the reviewers that read our paper and provided us with
very useful feedback.

We have revised the paper following the suggestions of the
reviewers. Please find the detailed comments to the reviewers below.

Best wishes,
Niccolò Veltri and Niels van der Weide

Indeed the use of bicategories in place of (2,1)-categories is
motivated by the existence of the bicategory theory library in
UniMath. We added a remark on this after Example 2.6.

This is correct. We added a comment on this in the final paragraph of
section 12, where we already discuss generalizations of our tecnhiques
to untruncated HITs.

The choice of pseudo/lax/oplax matters in the choice of 'triangles' in
the definition of cones and cocones. But since initial objects are
colimits over empty diagrams, in this case the choice of
pseudo/lax/oplax does not matter. We proved in UniMath that the
definition of initiality we gave in the paper (Definition 4.16) is
equivalent to the contractibility of the collection of maps x -> y
(https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/UniMath/Bicategories/Colimits/Initial.v).
We added a comment after Definition 4.16 which says that the two
definitions or biinitiality are equivalent.

The choice of pseudo/lax/oplax matters in Section 8.2 where we
consider inserters. In that definition, there is a choice for the
direction of the 2-cell \epsilon. We added a comment on this after
Definition 8.4.

We added a sentence on this in the end of the first paragraph at page 3.

True. We added comments on this after Example 3.5 (on the torus) and
in the beginning of Subsection 11.1 (on the circle).

All the constructors are now in the paper, see Figures 5 and 6. The
text in Construction 6.2 has been modified to include references to
and discussion of the constructors in the figures.

We improved our presentation including these suggestions. In
particular, the kernel is explicitly defined in Definition 10.9 and
the statement of Theorem 10.10 and its proof have been rephrased. The
improved Theorem 10.10 has also been formalized in UniMath.

We added a comment on this in the second paragraph of page 4.

It is true that UniMath forbids the use of general inductive
families. We state that we deviate from the UniMath philosophy on this
front in the beginning of page 5 after the link to the Coq code.

All minor comments of Reviewer 1 have been taken into account and
implemented as suggested.

Reviewer 2:

1) We added a more thorough discussion regarding the relation between
our work and Sojakova's in the first paragraph of the Related Work
section at page 3.

2) Thank you for providing this more precise reference. We added the
citation to Lumsdaine–Warren.

3) The biadjunctions in Figure 4 turn into biequivalences when
considering univalent groupoids instead of (plain) groupoids. We added
a comment on this after Construction 5.10.

4) We agree with this comment. The main changes on this side occurred
in Section 6, which we deemed particularly lacking in this regard. The
description of Construction 6.2, which has a central spot in our
development, has been expanded and all the constructors of types \sim
and \approx have been added in Figures 5 and 6.
