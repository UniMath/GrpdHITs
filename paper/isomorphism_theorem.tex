\subsection{The First Isomorphism Theorem}
Now let us prove a generalization of the first isomorphism theorem to the 1-truncated case.
Note that our proof follows the same steps as the proof of the first isomorphism theorem for sets.
Let us start by characterizing adjoint equivalences in $\algM(\sign)$.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:algebra_adjequiv}
Suppose we have a signature $\sign$, algebras $X, Y : \algM(\sign)$, and a homomorphism $f : X \onecell Y$.
Then $f$ is an adjoint equivalence in $\algM(\sign)$ if its carrier is an adjoint equivalence in $\onetypes$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\sign$ be a signature.
Suppose, we have algebras $X, Y : \algM(\sign)$ and a homomorphism $f : X \onecell Y$.
Then we have a congruence relation $R$ on $X$ with an equivalence ... 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof is done in three steps.
First, we define the congruence relation $R$ on $X$ by setting $R(x, y) := f(x) = f(y)$.
Second, we factor the map ... from $X$ to the image as a map ... from ... (quotient) to ... (image) using Construction \ref{constr:mapping_property_congruence}.
Lastly, we show that the acquired map is an equivalence using Proposition \ref{prop:algebra_adjequiv}.
This is done by showing that the fiber are contractible.
Showing that the fibers are inhabited and propositional is similarly to proving the surjectivity and injectivity for the set-theoretical first isomorphism theorem \cite{lynge2019}.
\end{proof}
